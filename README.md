# Event-Driven Inventory Management System in C#

This project demonstrates the use of **event-driven programming** in C# to create a **real-time inventory management system**. The system automatically tracks stock levels and sends **real-time alerts** when inventory reaches a low threshold. This is ideal for learning **C# events** and **delegates** in a business context.

## Features
- **Real-time inventory tracking**: Automatically monitors inventory levels.
- **Stock alerts**: Sends notifications when stock falls below the predefined threshold.
- **Event-driven design**: Uses **C# events** to trigger alerts, allowing for scalable and flexible code.
- **Customizable inventory levels**: Easily configure the minimum stock levels for alerts.
- **Simple to use**: Designed to be intuitive and easy to understand for both beginners and intermediate developers.
